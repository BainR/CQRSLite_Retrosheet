# I Wrote This To Learn the CQRS Pattern

I wanted to get my hands dirty programming CQRS.  The Exception Not Found series by Matthew Jones was a great place to start.  Switching to Retrosheet data for the source of the events forced me to learn the CQRS patterns rather than to simply copy code and claim to have learned something.  Switching from Asp.Net to DotNet Core both helped me to get my feet wet with DotNet Core and to learn the readiness of the tools for DotNet Core.  Switching from the default CQRSLite router to RabbitMQ for sending and publishing messages allowed me to try out more complex logic requiring two independent events to occur prior to processing a request.  And lastly, being able to run the code on both Windows and Linux computers was a real treat.  If you are interested in these topics, then you are welcome to try out my code.
