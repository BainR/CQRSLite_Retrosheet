# Better Options to Load Retrosheet Data

This program provides a way to load Retrosheet data into various platforms including SQL Server and Redis on both Windows and Linux.  But if you are only interested in loading the data, this application is not for you.  Retrosheet provides tools and instructions to extract its data into flat files.  The tools are efficient and get updated every year as needed.  Several other tools are available and supported for loading Retrosheet data into various SQL engines or into Excel files.

This tool is not designed to be efficient for loading the more than 12 million plays that exist on the Retrosheet server, it is not likely to be updated each year, and I'm not likely to offer much support to people trying to use it.
